# CONVERSATION SECURITY ANALYSIS

## CONTEXT
- **Conversation title**: {TITLE}
- **Number of messages**: {MESSAGE_COUNT}
- **Tokens analyzed**: {TOKEN_COUNT}
- **Source format**: {FORMAT}
- **File**: {FILE}

## MISSION

Analyze this conversation from a **cybersecurity** perspective and identify:

### 1. MENTIONED OR PRESENT VULNERABILITIES
List all vulnerabilities discussed, demonstrated or present in the code:
- Type of vulnerability (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)
- Criticality level (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Vulnerable code identified (if present)
- Possible exploitation

### 2. SECURITY BEST PRACTICES
Identify best practices mentioned or applied:
- Security techniques
- Recommended tools
- Secure configurations
- Industry standards (OWASP, NIST, etc.)

### 3. SECURE CODE VS VULNERABLE CODE
If code is present, compare:
- Vulnerable code snippets
- Proposed secure solutions
- Security libraries/frameworks used

### 4. MISSING RECOMMENDATIONS
Suggest security improvements that were NOT mentioned but would be relevant:
- Additional security measures
- Complementary analysis tools
- Recommended security tests

### 5. SECURITY MATURITY SCORE
Evaluate the conversation's security maturity:
- **Beginner** (1-3/10): Basic concepts, no implementation
- **Intermediate** (4-6/10): Known best practices, partial implementation
- **Advanced** (7-8/10): Secure architecture, complete tests
- **Expert** (9-10/10): Defense-in-depth, monitoring, compliance

### 6. COVERED SECURITY DOMAINS
Check the addressed domains:
- [ ] Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Injection Attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command)
- [ ] XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- [ ] CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- [ ] Cryptography
- [ ] Secrets management
- [ ] API Security
- [ ] Container Security
- [ ] Network Security
- [ ] Compliance & Regulations

**Important instructions:**
- Be PRECISE and FACTUAL in your analysis
- Cite concrete examples from the conversation
- Use OWASP terminology and CVEs when relevant
- Do not invent vulnerabilities that are not present
- If no code is present, focus on discussed concepts
- Rank vulnerabilities by criticality (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW)
- Be constructive: highlight what is well done AND what can be improved
- For non-technical conversations, indicate "NOT APPLICABLE - Non-security related conversation"
